# Arcana — Project Intelligence

## What This Is

Arcana (`@cj-ways/arcana`) is a curated agent skills CLI for Claude Code and Codex CLI. It ships 14 hand-authored skills, 2 agents, and 3 quality rules — all backed by SkillsBench data. Published on npm under `@cj-ways/arcana`. GitHub: `cj-ways/arcana`. MIT licensed.

**Current version:** 1.8.0 (14 skills + 2 agents + 3 quality rules)

## Your Role

You are the project owner, solution architect, lead developer, and release manager for Arcana. You make all decisions — architecture, skill design, CLI features, release strategy, quality standards. You ship to npm, push to GitHub, and handle everything end-to-end.

## Architecture

### CLI (`bin/arcana.js`)
- Entry point: Commander.js, 10 commands
- Commands: `init`, `add`, `remove`, `list`, `sync`, `update`, `import`, `use`, `doctor`, `info`
- All commands in `src/commands/*.js`, utilities in `src/utils/*.js`
- Dependencies: commander, inquirer, chalk, fs-extra (minimal, intentional)

### Content (the actual product)
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` — 14 skills (the core value)
- `agents/*.md` — 2 agents (code-reviewer, review-team)
- `rules/*.md` — 3 quality rules (methodology, quality, research)
- `migrations.json` — skill rename/removal migrations across versions
- `SKILL-AUTHORING-REFERENCE.md` — evidence-based authoring guide (22 sources, SkillsBench data)

### Skills Inventory

**Development Workflow:**
| Skill | Purpose | Key Feature |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| idea-audit | Validate project idea + scaffold | AI-optimized stack, Phase Execution Protocol |
| feature-audit | Interactive business audit | 13 perspectives + dynamic discovery, ONE QUESTION AT A TIME |
| v0-design | v0.dev prompt generation | 5 modes (Greenfield, Redesign, Component, Multi-page, Design System) |
| generate-tests | Auto-generate tests | Framework detection, complexity assessment |
| quick-review | Fast code review | False-positive suppression |
| deep-review | Multi-pass code review | 3 parallel agents (security, correctness, architecture) |
| create-pr | Create PR/MR | GitHub + GitLab auto-detection |
| deploy-prep | Release checklists | Risk prioritization matrix |

**Toolkit:**
| Skill | Purpose | Key Feature |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| security-check | Security scan | Secrets, vulns, deps, CVE research |
| find-unused | Dead code detection | Confidence tiers (SAFE/LIKELY/VERIFY) |
| persist-knowledge | Save patterns to docs | Auto-invoke + manual modes |
| agent-audit | Audit Claude Code config | Argument routing, research phase |
| import-skill | Import + adapt external skills | CLI fetches (`arcana import`), skill adapts (`/import-skill`) |
| skill-scout | Scout providers for useful skills | Fetches catalogs, cross-matches against codebase, recommends with evidence |

### Agents
- `code-reviewer` — Thin wrapper that loads `quick-review` skill. Triggers on conversational review requests (model: sonnet, tools: read-only)
- `review-team` — Thin wrapper that loads `deep-review` skill. Triggers on deep review requests (model: sonnet, effort: high)

### Supported Agents
- **Claude Code** — `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/rules/`
- **Codex CLI** — `.agents/skills/`, AGENTS.md discovery block
- **Multi-agent** — canonical in `.agents/skills/`, mirrors to `.claude/skills/`

Cursor and Gemini support was removed in v1.6.0 to focus on quality over coverage.

## Publishing & Infrastructure

### npm Publishing
- Token stored in `.npmrc` (gitignored) — `npm publish --access public --provenance` works without OTP
- Token also in `.claude/settings.local.json` env as `NPM_TOKEN`
- Use `node scripts/release.js <version>` to bump version across all 3 files
- Always update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version entry
- CI runs on push: GitHub Actions, Node 18/20/22, smoke tests

### Release Checklist
1. Make changes
2. `node scripts/release.js <version>` (bumps package.json, plugin.json, marketplace.json)
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
4. `git add` specific files (never `git add -A`)
5. Commit with descriptive message
6. `git push origin main`
7. Wait for CI to pass: `gh run list --limit 1`
8. `npm publish --access public --provenance`
9. Verify: `npm view @cj-ways/arcana version`

### File Structure

## Quality Standards

### Skill Authoring (from SKILL-AUTHORING-REFERENCE.md)
- **Description field**: Third person, includes what + when + boundaries, max 1024 chars
- **Body**: Third-person imperative, 1000-1200 words optimal, under 500 lines
- **Section ordering**: Quick Start → Gotchas → Procedures → Decision Points → Output → Validation
- **Gotchas go near the top** — instruction priority: early rules > late rules (confirmed by SkillsBench)
- **Per-step constraint design**: Procedural steps encourage divergence, criteria steps force convergence
- **Emphasis**: CAPS on max 2-3 rules. Explain WHY for everything else
- **`allowed-tools`**: All skills must declare allowed-tools in frontmatter, comma-separated format
- **Testing**: 20 eval queries (10 should-trigger, 10 should-not), run 3+ times each

### Key Findings (SkillsBench, 7,308 trajectories)
- Curated skills: +16.2pp improvement
- Optimal skill count: 2-3 skills (+18.6pp peak)
- Comprehensive docs: -2.9pp (HURTS performance)
- Detailed docs: +18.8pp (best)
- Self-generated skills: -1.3pp (no benefit)

## Known Issues

### CLI Code Quality
- `copy.js`: Legacy detection via name matching can false-positive on user skills with matching names
- No version tracking in skills — `update` blindly re-copies without knowing if changed

### Not Issues (intentional)
- Platform: Unix paths only (macOS/Linux target, not Windows)
- No dependency management between skills (intentional — skills are independent)
- No rollback (acceptable at current scale)

## Design Decisions

### v1.6.0 Changes (2026-03-20)
- **Dropped Cursor/Gemini** — focus on Claude Code + Codex CLI
- **Renamed `new-project-idea` → `idea-audit`** — consistent `*-audit` naming family
- **Migration system** — `migrations.json` handles skill lifecycle changes
- **Release script** — `scripts/release.js` prevents version drift
- **README rewritten** — why-first, workflow split, quantified claims
- **Feature documentation** — `docs/features/arcana-cli/` from comprehensive audit

### v1.5.0 Changes (2026-03-20)
- **Gotchas relocated to near-top in 10 skills**
- **v0-design: Design System mode added** — 5th mode
- **v0-design: Role principle added** — "Prompt Architect"

## How to Work on This Project

### Before making changes
1. Read the relevant SKILL.md files — understand what exists
2. Read SKILL-AUTHORING-REFERENCE.md before modifying any skill
3. Check CHANGELOG.md for recent changes and patterns
4. WebSearch for latest practices before recommending changes

### When modifying skills
- Gotchas section goes near the top (after Arguments)
- Use "## Gotchas" naming (standardized)
- Keep skills under 500 lines
- All skills must have `allowed-tools` in frontmatter (comma-separated format)
- Don't add features the user didn't ask for
- Test description changes against trigger/non-trigger scenarios

### Commit style
```
feat: description          — new features
fix: description           — bug fixes
chore: description         — maintenance (gitignore, versions, CI)
```
