# Changelog

## v1.8.0 (2026-03-21)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: rename migration deleted skills instead of moving** — `applyMigrations` used `removeSync` instead of `moveSync`, causing data loss on `arcana update` for users with renamed skills.
- **`copyAgents` marker broke frontmatter** — marker was prepended before `---` instead of after, corrupting YAML parsing for agent files.
- **`security-check` missing WebSearch in allowed-tools** — CVE lookup step mandated WebSearch but it was blocked by the frontmatter allowlist. Added `WebSearch, WebFetch`.
- **SSRF via HTTP URLs in import** — `resolveSource` accepted `http://` URLs. Now enforces HTTPS only.
- **Empty `normalizedName` wrote to skills root** — names like `.` or `---` normalized to empty string, writing files to wrong location. Added validation.
- **Path traversal guard in `use`/`info` missing trailing separator** — `startsWith(dir)` changed to `startsWith(dir + sep)`.
- **`sync --clean` deleted non-skill directories** — directories without `SKILL.md` in mirrors were silently removed. Now preserved.
- **`init` rename failure unchecked** — failed renames proceeded to overwrite user files. Now tracked and skipped.
- **`sync.js` error on stdout** — `console.log` changed to `console.error` for error messages.
- **`add.js`/`remove.js` errors on stdout** — usage and error messages moved to stderr.
- **Owner/repo URL manipulation** — added `GITHUB_SLUG` validation and `?#` fragment stripping.
- **Attribution `-->` injection** — `sourceLabel` now escaped in HTML comments.
- **Regex frontmatter rename fragile** — replaced with line-by-line `rewriteFrontmatterName()`.

### Added
- **Test suite expansion: 177 → 326 tests across 13 files** (was 7 files)
  - `tests/commands.test.js` — 27 integration tests for all CLI commands with exit code verification
  - `tests/detect.test.js` — 12 tests for agent detection logic
  - `tests/agents-md.test.js` — 6 tests for AGENTS.md generation
  - `tests/sync.test.js` — 8 tests for sync + `--clean` safety invariant
  - `tests/import-unit.test.js` — 25 tests for `resolveSource` + `validateFrontmatter`
  - `tests/version-sync.test.js` — 6 tests for version drift across package.json/plugin.json/marketplace.json
- **Upgrade path test** — e2e test simulating v1.5→v1.8 migration (rename + update + verify)
- **Exit code testing** — `run()` helper now returns `{output, status}`, error paths verified
- **`@vitest/coverage-v8`** — coverage tooling configured in `vitest.config.js`
- **macOS CI runner** — CI matrix now runs on `ubuntu-latest` + `macos-latest`
- **`npm test` runs Vitest** — canonical test gate now includes unit tests, not just smoke

### Changed
- **Extracted `src/utils/migrations.js`** — `loadMigrations` and `applyMigrations` moved from `update.js` for testability
- **Extracted `src/utils/agents-md.js`** — `appendAgentsMdBlock` moved from `sync.js` to utility layer
- **`detect.js` accepts optional `cwd` parameter** — all 3 functions testable without `process.chdir`
- **`import.js` exports pure functions** — `resolveSource` and `validateFrontmatter` exported for unit testing
- **`init.js` exports helper functions** — `hasArcanaSkills` and `copyRules` exported for testability
- **Skills test uses `parseFrontmatter`** — replaced ad-hoc regex with production parser
- **Network tests gated** — `SKIP_NETWORK_TESTS` env var skips GitHub API tests
- **Agent detection unified** — `add.js` now uses `suggestAgent()` from `detect.js` instead of duplicate logic

## v1.7.1 (2026-03-21)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: marketplace.json nested plugin version** — `plugins[0].version` was stuck at 1.5.0. Release script now uses `replaceAll` to catch all version fields including nested ones.
- **Feature docs updated** — roadmap and todo were stale after 3 releases in one session. Now reflect v1.7.x state.

## v1.7.0 (2026-03-21)

### Added
- **`skill-scout` skill** — scouts major skill providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Vercel) for skills that match the current project. Fetches catalogs, analyzes codebase, cross-matches gaps, recommends with evidence. Critical assessment — SKIP is the most common rating.
- 14th skill in the collection.

### Changed
- Skill count updated across README, CLAUDE.md, package.json, plugin manifests (13 → 14).

## v1.6.1 (2026-03-21)

### Added
- **`arcana import` CLI command** — fetch skills from GitHub repos (`owner/repo skill-name`), GitHub tree URLs, raw .md URLs, or local paths. Lists available skills, validates frontmatter, detects quality gaps, adds source attribution.
- **Rewritten `import-skill` SKILL.md** — now focuses on quality adaptation pipeline (Step 1-5: locate → audit → assess → adapt → verify). Works on any already-installed skill, not just freshly imported ones.
- **Import tests** — 9 tests covering GitHub fetch, local import, conflict detection, force overwrite, quality gap detection.

### Changed
- **`import-skill` description** — updated to reflect two-step flow: `arcana import` fetches, `/import-skill` adapts.
- **README** — import section now shows CLI examples instead of just skill usage.
- **CLI** — 10 commands (was 9), added `import` with `--force`, `--agent`, `--scope` options.

## v1.6.0 (2026-03-20)

### Breaking Changes
- **Dropped Cursor and Gemini support** — Arcana now targets Claude Code and Codex CLI only

### Added
- **Migration system (`migrations.json`)** — handles skill renames and removals across versions
- **Release script (`scripts/release.js`)** — bumps version across 3 files in one command
- **`allowed-tools` on all 13 skills** — standardized comma-separated format
- **Feature documentation** — `docs/features/arcana-cli/`
- **npm provenance** — added `--provenance` to publish workflow

### Changed
- **Renamed `new-project-idea` to `idea-audit`** — consistent `*-audit` naming family
- **README rewritten** — why-first positioning, workflow + toolkit skill split
- **`update` now triggers `sync`** — multi-agent mirrors stay in sync automatically
- **`update` now covers `~/.agents/skills/`** — previously missing user-level path

### Fixed
- **`copy.js` frontmatter parsing** — regex instead of `split("---")`
- **Rules conflict detection** — no longer silently overwrites
- **README accuracy** — correct agent count, no Cursor/Gemini references

## v1.5.0 (2026-03-20)

### Added
- **v0-design: Design System mode** — new 5th mode for generating design system prompts (color palettes, typography scales, spacing, component styling). Full end-to-end support across all 7 steps.
- **v0-design: Role principle** — "Prompt Architect" behavioral boundary (structural decisions yours, aesthetic decisions v0's) prevents agents from overstepping into design research
- **v0-design: v0 ecosystem integration** — references v0 Design System registries, saved Instructions, and Design Mode for iteration
- **v0-design: Design system prompt template** — 800-1200 word comprehensive template covering colors, typography, spacing, shadows, component styling, and interaction patterns

### Enhanced
- **Gotchas relocated to near-top in 10 skills** — moved from bottom of file to after Arguments section per Arcana's own SKILL-AUTHORING-REFERENCE.md (instruction priority: early rules > late rules). Affected: deep-review, deploy-prep, feature-audit, find-unused, generate-tests, new-project-idea, persist-knowledge, quick-review, security-check, v0-design
- **Gotchas naming standardized** — "Common Agent Gotchas" renamed to "Gotchas" across all skills for consistent terminology
- **v0-design: Gotchas expanded** — merged Gotchas + Anti-Patterns into unified 10-item section with mode-scoped guidance (e.g., "Over-constraining colors in page prompts" vs "defining tokens in Design System mode")

### Fixed
- **v0-design description field** — "researches design references" → "researches user-specified design references" (prevented agents from proactively researching design systems)
- **v0-design theme question** — rephrased from "Fresh theme or match existing project colors?" to "Should v0 design within your existing color palette, or choose its own?" (keeps v0 positioned as aesthetic decision-maker)
- Plugin version sync — plugin.json and marketplace.json now match package.json (were stuck at 1.4.0)

## v1.4.1 (2026-03-20)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Legacy Arcana skills (pre-1.4.0) were falsely detected as "custom" conflicts — improved `isArcanaManaged()` with frontmatter name matching fallback
- Rules warning no longer fires when existing rules are Arcana's own rules from a prior install

### Added
- Interactive conflict resolution during `init`: Override all / Rename my skills / Skip
- `arcana add --force` flag to bypass conflict detection
- `renameExistingSkill()` and `renameExistingAgent()` utilities for the rename flow
- CI test script (`npm test` runs CLI smoke tests)

## v1.4.0 (2026-03-20)

### Added
- `deep-review` skill — multi-perspective code review with 3 parallel specialized reviewers
- `quick-review` skill — fast single-pass review (code-reviewer agent converted to skill format)
- `v0-design` skill — generate optimized v0.dev prompts for UI design
- `review-team` agent — agent team that spawns security, correctness, and architecture reviewers
- Effort levels (`effort:` frontmatter) on all 13 skills for optimal reasoning depth
- Worktree isolation (`isolation: worktree`) on review skills for safe analysis
- Project memory (`memory: project`) on review skills for cross-session learning
- Gotchas sections added to 10 skills (40+ documented agent failure patterns)

### Enhanced
- `feature-audit` — 13 universal perspectives + dynamic feature-specific discovery via WebSearch
- `new-project-idea` — WebSearch for competitive landscape + phase plan validation
- `security-check` — CVE research via WebSearch + context-aware false positive guidance
- `deploy-prep` — risk prioritization matrix (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) + user confirmation
- `find-unused` — confidence-based output tiers (SAFE TO DELETE / LIKELY UNUSED / VERIFY FIRST)
- `generate-tests` — complexity assessment + test quality checklist
- `persist-knowledge` — auto-invocation quality check + gotchas

### Fixed
- Plugin marketplace.json updated with required `owner` field
- README updated: 7 → 13 skills, accurate descriptions

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- `import-skill` skill — import external skills from GitHub/URL/local and adapt to Arcana quality standards
- `SKILL-AUTHORING-REFERENCE.md` — evidence-based guide for writing agent skills (22 cited sources)
- `allowed-tools` frontmatter to all skills that were missing it
- `argument-hint` frontmatter to agent-audit, find-unused, create-pr, deploy-prep
- `tools` restriction to code-reviewer agent (read-only enforcement)
- Expanded secret detection patterns: Slack, Google Cloud, Twilio, SendGrid, updated GitHub/GitLab tokens
- Expanded vulnerability detection: ORM raw query injection, SSRF, path traversal
- Limitations section to security-check (transparency about grep-based heuristics)

### Fixed

- CRITICAL: Removed XML `<example>` tags from create-pr description (spec violation)
- Rewrote all descriptions in third person per Anthropic best practices
- Added trigger phrases to find-unused and persist-knowledge descriptions
- Removed hardcoded "Desktop/Additional Projects" path from new-project-idea

- `security-check` skill — hardcoded secrets, common vulnerabilities, dependency audit
- `generate-tests` skill — auto-detect framework, match existing patterns, generate tests
- Gemini CLI support (`.gemini/skills/`) — init, add, sync, list, remove, doctor
- `arcana sync --clean` flag — remove stale skills from mirrors not in canonical
- Smart mirror targets — sync only creates dirs for agents you actually use

### Changed
- Multi-agent mode now includes Gemini (Claude + Codex + Cursor + Gemini)
- Agent choices expanded: claude, codex, gemini, multi
